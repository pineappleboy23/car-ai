# car-ai
my first attempt at ai I wrote it in 2 days and all ai are my own ideas

i know it is crappy

i am open to all advice

update 2/26/2021
  i added generations this greatly improves the ai
  obviously I have now spent more than "2 days" at this point
  
  
update 2/27/2021
  i fixed bug where ai's got killed twice leading to miscount and failure
    
    
update 2/28/2021
  deleted all back pointing distance checkers
  ai change rate now varies from 1/5 to 1/20
